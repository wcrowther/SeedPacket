        <h3>SeedOne Extension Method</h3>
        <p>
            An additional method included in the example is <b>SeedOne()</b> which is implementation for just getting back
            a fully-populated single instance of the type. It is an extension on any class that implements the new() constructor
            (with no constructor parameters).  While perhaps not the most efficient code, it shows how you can create alternative
            extensions that utilize SeedPacket code generation.
